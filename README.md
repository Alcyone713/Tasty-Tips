# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a recipe app which uses edamam recipe API to fetch for results. The user can enter any ingredient in the search bar and he/she will be provided with 10 recipes that can be made with that ingredient. 

It is hosted on github pages.
